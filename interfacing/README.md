# Interfacing Scripts

Make sure to change the network device name (ex. enp3s0) in restart_docker_containers.sh and shutdown_robots.sh to the name of the network device of the computer.

To check the network device name of the computer (assuming the computer is connected to internet via a router), run
```
ifconfig
```
and look for a device with an 'inet' ip address with 192.168.1.x.
